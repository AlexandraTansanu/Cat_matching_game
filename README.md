# Memory cards game

Memory cards replicates the 'Memory cards matching game' for little children. 

**How it works:** The user is required to find matching pairs of crads. Each square of the displayed grid represents a different card. Crads come in identical pairs, thus the grid will always be a quadratic matrix. The user must click a card to reveal the picture underneath and then click another to find its corresponding pair. If he managed to do that, the cards will remain revealed and the pictures will darken. Otherwise, the cards will flip back again and the user should memorize the pictures' position for future reference.  

**How it was built:** The program makes use of the OOP principles such that every object (i.e., brick, bat, ball) is an entity of a sparate class. To build the wall of bricks, a 2-D array list was used.
